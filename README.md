### Final Project - Building A Predictive Model via Different Platforms

# Dataset Source: [Diabetes 130-US Hospitals for Years 1999-2008](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008)

## Business Context

The dataset contains ten years (1999â€“2008) of clinical care records collected from 130 hospitals and integrated delivery networks across the United States. It comprises more than 50 characteristics that capture detailed information on patient demographics, diagnoses, treatments, and hospital-related outcomes.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that determines the readmission status of diabetic patients. The target variable categorizes patients into three groups: those who are readmitted within 30 days, those readmitted after 30 days, and those not readmitted at all. This classification task holds significant value in healthcare settings, as early identification of high-risk patients enables hospitals to implement timely interventions, reduce preventable readmissions, and allocate resources more effectively.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of 101,766 patient records and 50 attributes, offering a rich, structured view of inpatient encounters involving diabetic patients in the United States. These attributes cover a wide range of information, including demographic characteristics (such as race, gender, and age), hospitalization details (like admission type, discharge disposition, and number of inpatient visits), diagnostic codes, procedures, medications, and clinical outcomes.
